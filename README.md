# game-snake
The classic arcade game Snake, developed with Javascript and HTML5 Canvas.

The primary focus in this project was to write clean, readable code. I attempted to write the code neatly, assign descriptive names to variables and arrays, apply my knowledge of object oriented programming properly, and add comments to explain anything that wasn't obvious and to divide the code into sections.

I am very satisfied with the result.
